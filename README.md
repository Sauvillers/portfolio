## ðŸ“Œ Please read if you tend to use my website

I have open-sourced this website as an inspiration / reference project, or starting template for other aspiring developers. But please do credit me if you tend to use this website as your own. I have spent several amount of hours during my free time to create the perfect portfolio website of my liking, so please **do not claim it as your own**!

More features will be added over time (Blog,...), so keep an eye out for updates!

If you do find any issues, please open an issue here, and I'll look right into it.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

### Project structure

The project structure looks very simular to any other Astro project, it includes the following folders and files:
